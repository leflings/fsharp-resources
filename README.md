# fsharp-resources

This is just a collection of links, videos, cheatsheets whatever that i want to
hold on to. And what better place than a git repository.

#### Introductions

[The original Luca Bolognese presention on/of F#. Very recommended](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/pdc2008/TL11)

#### Articles

[F# for C# developers: Creating escaped concat/split functions in F#](http://www.blogs.sigristsoftware.com/marcsigrist/post/F-for-C-developers-Creating-escaped-concatsplit-functions-in-F.aspx) - "advanced" and dense article, but very informative

#### Gasoline on the fire

*Various articles that aren't very informative for people new to F#, but can be
convincing if you're on the fence*

[Why F# became my goto language](https://mrange.wordpress.com/2014/12/20/why-fsharp-became-my-goto-language/)

#### Interviews

[Paulmichael Blasucci on Practical Property-Based Testing with FsCheck and F#](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/blasucci-fsharp-fscheck?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global) - 30 min interview with a Microsoft MVP on certain merits of F#. Not particularly informative.
